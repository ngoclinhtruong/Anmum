            <p>Hi mummy-to-be! Now that you’re pregnant, your body needs a lot more macronutrients and micronutrients because you have a little one growing inside of you. Your need for certain nutrients such as protein, folate and iron increases by as much as 50%*. And it can also be quite a challenge for you to get enough of these nutrients from the everyday Malaysian diet.</p>
            <p>But, what are macronutrients and micronutrients?</p>
            <p>Here’s the general rule of thumb. <strong>Macronutrients</strong> provide our body with energy and they are substances we need in large quantity. <strong>Micronutrients</strong> are essential nutrients for our body to function healthily and we need them in smaller amounts.</p>

          <h3>Why are these nutrients important </br>for pregnant mummies?</h3>
          <p>It is important that pregnant mums to consume enough of both <strong>macronutrients</strong> and <strong>micronutrients</strong> and these are the reasons why:</p>

              <h4>Production of red blood cells</h4>
              <p>During pregnancy, your body will start to produce higher amounts of red blood cells. These cells help carry oxygen throughout your body and to your little one. To help your body produce enough red blood cells, you will need to consume sufficient amounts of nutrients below.</p>

                      <h5>Folate</h5>
                      <p>Or also known as folic acid, this is a type of B vitamin. This vitamin helps the production of DNA and therefore important in new cell formations. Getting sufficient folate is especially important during pregnancy because it facilitates the rapid cell growth and development of your little one’s spinal cord and brain. It also reduces the risk of neural tube defects; and works closely with vitamin B12 to help make red blood cells. Sources of folate are dark leafy greens such as spinach and mustard greens or avocado and beans.</p>

                      <p>Iron is an essential nutrient for the production of red blood cells. It helps produce hemoglobin – a type of protein found in red blood cells that helps the blood carry oxygen from the lungs to other parts of your body and to your little one. Foods from animal sources like meat, poultry and fish are rich in iron. Alternatively, beans and dark leafy greens such as spinach are rich in iron as well. </p>

It is also an essential vitamin for maintaining healthy nerves and DNA reproduction. Vitamin B12 is a unique vitamin because it can only be found almost exclusively in foods derived from animals. Try consuming more fish, shellfish, meat, poultry, eggs and milk for more vitamin B12. </p>

Getting yourself exposed to sunlight daily will kickstart your body to produce its own vitamin D. Try not to apply sunblocks that are SPF8 or higher as it tends to prevent vitamin D production. Other than that, vitamin D is limited to a few food sources. You can find them in egg yolks, fatty fishes like salmons and sardines and Anmum Materna. </p>
