          <p>Hi mummy-to-be! When you’re pregnant, your body will demand more nutrients simply because there’s a child growing inside you. Your need for certain macronutrients and micronutrients such as protein, folate and iron, increases by as much as 50%*; however it can be a challenge to get nutrients from these 2 groups from your usual diet to meet all your nutritional needs during pregnancy. </p>
          <p>*USDRI</p>
          <p>Here’s the general rule of thumb: <strong>Macronutrients</strong> provide our body with energy and they are substances we need in large quantity. <strong>Micronutrients</strong> are essential nutrients for our body to function healthily and we need them in smaller amounts.</p>
